## Overview
This code imports, explores and analyzes a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company. Two files are imported, concatinated and explored. Groupby and pivot tables were used to identify the region with the highest sales in units and total sales, the retailer with the highest total sales, and the retailer which solde the most women's athletic footwear. Then the day and week of the highest total sales of women's athletic footwear were identified by resambling a filtered pivot table.

## Python Functionality Implemented

* functions (info, pd.concat, isnull, sum, pd.to_datetime, groupby, rename, sort_values, pd.pivot_table, unique, .loc, resample, .strftime)
* Importing .csv files

## Set Up
* The files wihtin the athletic_sales_analysis repo were updated using Python version 3.10.14, in Jupyter Notebook. To run it, please download the most recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), as well as a code editor that runs Python ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=mac), etc.).
* Copy the file link from GitHub (Click the Code dropdown button and copy the HTTPS URL to clipboard)
* Clone the file from GitHub into the desired folder on your computer (type: "git clone <link to file>" and press enter)
## Run Instructions:
In Terminal (Mac) or GitBash (Windows):
* Ensure that you're running the correct version of Python (see Set Up above)
